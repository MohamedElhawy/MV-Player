Hi, Mohamed here!

This is a little project of a custom made "web video player" called MV Player. 

It is made using modern web technologies with some of my own logic.

It is really strong coded, making it customizable , cross platform (Adapt to different screen sizes) and has potential for many features to be implemented into.

Please feel free to take part in this project as you like.

ok, thats it. bye for now.
